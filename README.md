# To Do List App

The To Do List App is a simple web-based application that allows users to manage and organize their tasks in an easy and intuitive way. With features like adding new items, marking items as completed, deleting items, and reordering tasks, this app provides a user-friendly interface to help users keep track of their tasks efficiently.
